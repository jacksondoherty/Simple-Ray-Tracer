Simple Ray Tracer.

Makefile written for Ubuntu.
Run "make" then "./main" in terminal.
The CLI should begin running.

Make sure to have the image window selected 
	when entering commands.

With the CLI running, try "read test.cli" to 
	produce an example ray traced image with three 
	lights of different color, one sphere and two 
	cuboids.  

The result should look like "test.png."
