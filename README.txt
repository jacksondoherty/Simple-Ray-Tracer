Simple Ray Tracer.

NOTE #1: This program is for educational purposes.
  A production-level ray tracer would likely
  want to eliminate classes etc. for performance.

NOTE #2: All code labeled with '/* CS3258 SUPPLIED CODE */'
  was provided by the Computer Graphics course taught at 
  Vanderbilt University.  It's mainly boilerplate to setup 
  the windowing system and makes up roughly < 5% of the 
  total code. 

This program works with Ubuntu.
Run "make" then "./main" in terminal.
The CLI should begin running.

Make sure to have the image window selected 
  when entering commands.

With the CLI running, try "read test.cli" to 
  produce an example ray traced image with three 
  lights of different color, one reflective sphere 
  and two cuboids. 
  
The result should look like "test.png."
